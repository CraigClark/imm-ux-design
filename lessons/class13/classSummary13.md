## Learning Outcome

In this lesson, students continue practical work with prototyping and learn about design systems. Skills learned in class will be applied to making a prototype in Figma.

### Prior to Class

- Prototyping 1 and 2
- Design theory 1 and 2

### During Class

- Design systems
- Interactive Design 2
  - Using Figma
    - In-class activity: Building a form prototype together

### After class

- have skills necessary to build a prototype in Figma using complex components.

## Assigned

## Lessons, Activities, and Resources

### In class activity: Figma prototype

#### Description

In class, we will build a prototype in Figma together. We will build screens, create interactions and learn how to share for review.

Our Planet Burgers client has asked us to add a form for ordering pizza.
The form will allow clients to select a topping. It is required that they select at lease one topping.

They also want an option to sign up for a mail list

[here is a working example](https://www.figma.com/proto/0WJ909oG4loHtZ2Gb9QjDJ/Planet-diner-order-form?type=design&node-id=12-427&t=3wXH9i63yyelH9u1-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=1%3A4&starting-point-node-id=12%3A427&mode=design) of what we will build.

#### Details

Using the starter files provided, follow the instructor's instructions to build your prototype.
