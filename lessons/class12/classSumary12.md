## Lessons, Activities, and Resources

### Lessons

We will continue with our lesson on user testing by making our own card
sorts. This will introduce you to online-tools available for different
aspects of user testing.

User Centred Design (UCD) is an approach to design where we focus on
gaining a deep understanding of the people who will use our product. Two
key tools we use to understand our users are personas and user stories.
In this class, we will learn how to make a thorough analysis of our
users behaviour.
