## Lessons, Activities, and Links

### Working freelance

Working freelance can be a rewarding experience. It also has some pit-falls that we need to know how to deal with.

### Activities

#### Student Evaluations

Student Evaluation for Fall 2022. (15 minutes.)

The college uses your feedback to improve the delivery of the program.

In the past, I have used course feedbacks to make adjustments to the curriculum delivery and assignment criteria. The class on working freelance, for example, was developed primarily out of student feedback.

As per policy AA25 (Student Course Feedback), student anonymity and confidentiality will be protected in the administration of Student Course Feedback surveys and the reporting of the results. Information is not released that would identify students who have or have not completed their student course feedback surveys.
