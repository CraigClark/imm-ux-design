## Lessons, Activities, and Resources

### Group activity: Review sites for cognitive load

#### Description

Students will review sites to evaluate their impact on cognitive load.

#### Details

* With a partner, take 15 minutes to find two websites to review.
* For one site, identify what has been done to reduce cognitive load.
* For the other site, discuss what they could do to reduce cognitive load.
* Results will be discussed with the class

### Group activity: Identifying scarcity

#### Description

Students will review websites to see how they are implementing scarcity.

#### Details

* With a partner, find a website to review
* Evaluate how the website uses scarcity
  * Is the site using scarcity? Why or why not?
* Results will be discusses as a class

### Group activity: Identifying simplified choices

#### Description

Students will review websites to see how they are implementing simplified choices.

#### Details

* With a partner, find a website to review
* Evaluate how the website uses simplified Choices
