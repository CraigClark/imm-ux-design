# A02 Website Redesign

## Title

Website Redesign

## Purpose

In previous classes and assignments, you learned about information hierarchy, design theory, web psychology and accessibility. This assignment evaluates your ability to apply knowledge learned in class to solve problems on an existing website.

## Grading

20% of final mark

## Description

Redesign a website (at least three pages) to improve the user experience on the site. As part of the redesign, you will be updating your client's brand with a new logo, typography and a colour scheme.

## Details

Using what you have learned in class, you will work with a poorly designed website and recreate its homepage and two other inside pages to improve the user experience. Additionally, you will be creating a new brand identity.

A list of websites that need to be redesigned has been put together by the professor. Sites to be redesigned will be randomly assigned. For this assignment, you will apply all you have learned in class:

- accessibility
- design theory
- colour theory
- web psychology
- information hierarchy
- creating an interactive prototype
- gathering constructive feedback

> It is not necessary to duplicate the information structure of the existing site. Part of the evaluation is seeing how well you can re-organize content when needed.

## Required

**Your Assignment should include:**

### Part 1: PDF Document with the following pages

_Please submit pages in order._

#### 1. Cover Page

- include the project title, assignment title, your name, date
- Table of contents
  - include all sections of your project with a title and page number
  - the last item in the table of contents should be links to your Figma prototypes

#### 2. Critique section

- Critiques of the current website from three classmates.
- Critiques to include feedback on homepage and the two internal pages you have chosen
- Screen capture of the desktop version of the existing homepage.
- link to the existing site

#### 3. Rebranding section

- Thumbnails for a new logo (minimum 10)
- Image of the new logo
- Typography swatch:
  - The fonts you will use and how you will use them
  - Paragraph on why you have chosen these fonts, keep it under 200 words. I want to know specifically why the typography choices are suitable for your client. You don't need to describe the font, I can see it.
- Colour swatch:
  - Primary, secondary, accent and neutral colours you will use
  - Identify the colour scheme you are using.
  - Paragraph on why you have chosen these colours, keep it under 200 words. I want to know why the colours suite the client.

#### 4. Redesigned section

- 12 thumbnails for a new mobile layout
- 12 thumbnails for a new desktop layout
- Link to Figma mobile prototype, test the link
- Link to Figma desktop prototype, test the link
- Screen capture of the desktop version of the redesigned homepage.

#### 5. Critique of redesign

- Critiques of your redesign from three different people, preferably the same three people who did the original critique.
- Feedback should be provided as comments in Figma, copy the comments (not screenshot) into the assignment.
- Critique response
  - Identify the type(s) of feedback you received
  - Is the feedback valuable? Why or why not?
  - Would you change anything about your design based on the feedback? Why or why not?

#### 6. Explanation section

- Explain how your redesign improves the user experience of your selected site. Use examples of what you have done, and how your design complies with what we have learned in class. Be specific, talk about the web psychology and design principals you have implemented.

### Part 2: Interactive Prototype in Figma

- Prototypes must be a minimum of three pages. If you would like to do more, that is fine.
- Use Figma to make a mobile prototype
- Use Figma to make a desktop prototype
- The pages of your prototype need to be linked together (make sure I can navigate the prototype)
- Interactions must be complete, I can return to the original state
- put the mobile and desktop prototypes on separate pages
- label pages, frames and layers
- use a 12 column grid

### Additional

The following will also be evaluated:

- Overall Presentation
- Level of Details
- Creativity
- Usability
- Accessibility
- Explanation page matches what is in the design

### Screen sizes

- **Mobile:** Use the Figma frame for _iPhone 14 & 15 pro_
- **Desktop:** Use the Figma frame for _Macbook pro 16"_

## Submission

### Share the prototype

- Name the mobile prototype `A02-Latsname-Firstname-mobile`
- Name the desktop prototype `A02-Latsname-Firstname-desktop`
- make sure you publish prototypes without a password
- make sure you publish prototypes for review so people can comment

### In Brightspace

Combine all elements into ONE PDF, along with an Original Content Notice, which needs to be included for all assignments. Hand in a digital copy of your assignment through Brightspace.

- Name the pdf `A02-Latsname-Firstname.pdf`
- In the comment box in BrightSpace, add:

  - A link to each of the pages on the original site you are designing
  - Link to your mobile prototype
  - Link to desktop prototype

  _Test your links! Students have received 0 in the past because of broken links._
