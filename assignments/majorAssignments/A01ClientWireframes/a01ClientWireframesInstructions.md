# Wireframe (Part One - Maplebrook Public Library)

The city of Maplebrook is re-branding their library, which includes the development of a website. As a member of the design team, you will create the wireframes for the new site.

## Purpose

In previous classes and assignments, you learned the value of wireframes in the early stages of a project. You will apply knowledge of design theory and information hierarchy to create professional wireframes in Figma. This assignment introduces you to thinking about design from the point of view of the users while meeting the client’s objectives.

## Grading

## Description

You are to create two wireframes for the Maplebrook Public Library (MPL). This is the first of a three-part assignment. You will make a mock-up of your design in your Graphic Applications class and eventually coding it into a webpage for your Web Design class.

The attached client description includes the programs, services, and events at Maplebrook Public Library. You decide how these will be promoted on the homepage. Remember, a wireframe does not contain content, it provides information on how types of content will be displayed.

To start, MPL is requesting a home page to include: a masthead (title banner), primary navigation, main content area, and footer. Any other additional sections that you feel may make the user’s experience more inviting should be implemented in the wireframes. Keep in mind that the final product will be a fully functional web page. You will be starting with a mobile-first wireframe and then continuing on to create a desktop wireframe as well.

You will develop the typography and colour scheme for your client.
