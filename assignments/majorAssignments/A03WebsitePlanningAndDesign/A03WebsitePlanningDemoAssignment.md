## Client description

Partners Lin and Noah started flower Freaks in the summer of 1970, one year after they met at the Woodstock music festival. The shop is a local flower shop in Rockland Ontario. On their retirement, Lin and Noahâ€™s daughters Sarah took over operations. Sarah noticed that a lot of clients are interested in growing, not just purchasing bouquets of cut flowers. She started an Instagram account where she talked about how to grow flowers, species of flowers, edible and medicinal flowers. Quickly she had hundreds of thousands of followers. This increased after Covid hit. Many people were no longer sending flowers to others, but they were growing their own a lot more. Sarah shifted the focus of Flower Freaks to a place where people could buy equipment, seeds and attend classes related to the growing, care and use of flowers. Sarah plans to sell online and hire a service to look after shipping for her. People can pay to take online classes from Sarah and the other staff. While you can still order cut flowers from Flower Freaks, it is no longer the primary focus of the company.

Flower Freaks currently has a website, it is used to order cut flowers. There is a strong social media presence, particularily on instagram.

<summary>Decisions on *About* section</summary>
I made up everything about Freaky Flowers based on what I thought would be a fun flower store. I know there are people who really love flowers, and are into growing their own. I thought it would be interesting to have a flower shop that went beyond selling cut flowers for decoration and celebration.

I chose to include the history because it sets the tone of the company. The change in the business direction gives me a focus to work with. I have an idea what the audience is interested in, but not who they are.

Information about the client and audience should dictate everything you do on the project
