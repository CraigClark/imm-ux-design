## Team Meetings

### First Meeting

The first meeting with your team is called a kickoff meeting.

During this meeting, you'll:

1. Choose your communication method
2. Define your client
3. Outline your work plan
4. Schedule future meetings

#### Choosing Your Communication Method

Decide the best way to keep in touch. It could be meeting in person, emailing, using a messaging app like Discord, or texting. The most important part is that everyone agrees and can use the chosen method.

#### Defining Your Client

Start by creating a description of your client. Understanding who your client is will influence many of your project decisions. Remember to refer to your client description regularly to ensure your project is on track. See _Part 1, requirement 03 | Client description_ for a list of thing to consider when describing your client.

#### Outlining Your Work Plan

Consider all the tasks you need to complete and plan how to tackle them as a team. It's also crucial to decide the order of tasks since some tasks depend on the completion of others.

#### Scheduling Future Meetings

Determine how often you'll meet. A good practice is to have a 10-minute check-in every two days throughout the project. These meetings are to ensure everyone is clear on their tasks and to identify and solve problems early. Adjust the frequency and length of these meetings as needed based on your project's progress.
