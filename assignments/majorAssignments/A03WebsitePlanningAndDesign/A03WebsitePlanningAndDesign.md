- Characteristics of the primary and secondary target audiences: _Consider: age, language, commonalities, barriers, career, location, computer skill level_

#### Part 1, requirement 06 | User research (max 500 words)

_Refer to class 07: user research_

Write about how you would research user needs.

- How do you find out if users can complete the desired Call To Action (CTA)?

#### Part 1, requirement 09 | feedback

_refer to class 11: critique and feedback_

Publish the prototype created in part 2. Show your prototype to three individuals. They can be classmates, but they don’t have to be. Ask them to leave feedback on your work. It is fine if they comment directly on the prototype, but copy the comments to your assignment.

> **TIP:** copy the feedback text to your assignment. Screenshots are not accessible and are poor design.

Write about the feedback (max 350 words)

- Identify what types of feedback you have received; reaction, direction, or critique.
- Would you implement the feedback you gather on the next version of the prototype? Why or why not?

> **Important!**
> When providing feedback, use evidence based on what we have learned.
>
> ie. Instead of "headings should have the same alignment" write "To follow the principal of repetition, all headings should have the same alignment. I recommend aligning to the left to follow the principals of Gutenberg readability.

### Part 2: Design system and prototype in Figma

#### Part 2, requirement 1 | Design system

_refer to:_

- _class 13: design systems_
- _class 4: elements of a logo_
- _class 3 and 4: design theory_

Build a design system in Figma for your client.

- Design a logo for your client and include it here
- Include all reusable elements, for example:
  - typography | headings, paragraphs, emphasized text, summaries, captions, sub-headings etc
  - colours | primary, secondary, neutral as well as any variations you will use
  - links | active, hover, visited, links for different purposes
  - buttons | primary, secondary, default, hover state
  - navigation | primary, secondary, footer, icons
  - cards | all the variations, for example, with and without images, with and without links, with and without headings or body text
  - form elements and controls | checkboxes, radios, text fields, text areas, labels, select lists, etc

Where necessary, include mobile and desktop versions of elements.

#### Part 2: requirement 2 | Functional prototype

_refer to classes 2, 5, 13 : prototyping_

Build a mobile and a desktop prototype of your website.

You must design a minimum of 5 pages:

1. the home page
2. One page must have a form on it. The form must include at least three different form elements and a way to submit the form.
3. Form submission confirmation. (what happens after a user submits the form)
4. Other than the home page, the rest are your choice.
5. Besides the navigation, your prototype must include one at least other interaction of your choice. For the purposes of this assignment, _scroll to top_ is not acceptable as the only interaction.

##### Notes on the prototype

- 5 pages means 5 pages of a website. That works out to at least 10 pages total. Five mobile, five desktop.
- For Mobile, use the iphone 14/15 pro (393 x 852) frame
- For Desktop, use the Macbook pro 16" (1728 x 1117) frame
- You can use whatever interactions you like, other than _scroll to top_, but they need to be complete interactions. A complete interaction means there is a straightforward way to return to the initial state.

- Your prototype must be navigable. For example, there needs to be a way to get from the home page to your other pages and back again.
- Use actual words for headings, titles, labels and navigation, lorem ipsum is fine for body content
- For feedback, it’s fine to have people comment directly on the prototype, however you need to copy the feedback to your assignment.

> **Design system as components**
> The expectation is that you will use components from the design system in the prototypes

### Additional

The following will also be evaluated:

- Creativity
- Overall Presentation
- Overall Detail of Information
- Accessibility (_refer to class 9: Design for everyone_)
- Implementation of design theory (_refer to class 2: design theory and class 3: colour theory_)

## Submission

Only one person from your group needs to submit the assignment. Everyone in your group will receive the same grade.

### Part 1: Website planning and evaluation

- Combine the written assignment, Personas, and OCN into **ONE PDF**
- Hand in the PDF of your assignment through Brightspace.
- Do not submit a .zip file.
- The Original Content Notice (OCN) should be the last page.
- The OCN need not have a page number on it and do not include in the table of contents
- Name the pdf `A03-Latsname01-Lastname02-Lastname03-websitePlanningAndEvaluation.pdf`

### Part 2: Figma design system and prototype

- Create a team in Figma for your design system and prototype called _A03 Latsname01 Lastname02 Lastname03_
- Include <clarkc@algonquincollege.com> as a member of the team
- in the team, create a project called _A03 ClientName - Latsname01 Lastname02 Lastname03_
- include the links to your published Figma project in the brightspace notes.
- make sure your design system and prototype are separate pages. The expectation is:
  - a page for assets (optional)
  - a page for the design system (required)
  - a page for the design system (required)
  - a page for the mobile prototype (required)
  - a page for the desktop prototype (required)
- in the comment field in Brightspace, include:
  - A link to your figma project
  - A link to your published mobile prototype
  - A link to your published desktop prototype
