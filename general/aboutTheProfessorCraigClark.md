Hello, my name is Craig Clark

## About me

I am a multimedia specialist, digital strategist and artist. Besides teaching at Algonquin College, I work as a project manager and front-end developer, I work freelance and volunteers my skills to community organizations. My work primarily focusses on web development, illustration and the strategic use of digital communication. I am an award-winning artist and have received a Government and Technology (GTEC) award for work on bringing digital services to indigenous communities. I am an advocate for accessibility and inclusive design and have presented on these issues internationally. When I'm not working, I enjoy gardening, painting and getting lost in sci-fi and fantasy stories.
